# Cat-vs.-Dog-Classification-with-Heatmap-Visualization
This project is a machine learning model that can classify images into two categories: cats and dogs. It is also able to generate a heatmap on the image to visualize the features that it used to make its decision. The model can be used to classify any random image, as long as it contains a cat or a dog.

#Project Motivation:

This project was motivated by the desire to learn more about machine learning and to build a model that could solve a real-world problem. Cat vs. dog classification is a common task in computer vision, and it has many potential applications, such as image search, social media, and security.

#Project Methodology:

The model was built using InceptionV3, which is a type of artificial neural network that is well-suited for image classification tasks. The InceptionV3 was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 images of cats and dogs.

Once the model was trained, it was evaluated on a held-out test set of images. The model achieved an accuracy of over 96% on the test set, which is state-of-the-art performance for this task.

#Project Results:

The model is able to classify images of cats and dogs with high accuracy. It is also able to generate heatmaps on the images to visualize the features that it used to make its decision.

#Project Applications:

The model could be used in a variety of applications, such as:

*Image search: The model could be used to help users find images of cats and dogs on the web.
*Social media: The model could be used to automatically classify images uploaded to social media platforms.
*Security: The model could be used to identify cats and dogs in security footage.

#Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning for image classification tasks. The model is able to achieve high accuracy and can be used in a variety of real-world applications.

Supervised learning: The model was trained on a dataset of labeled images, which is a type of supervised learning.
Feature extraction: The model is able to extract features from images, which are the characteristics that it uses to make its decision.
Heatmap visualization: The model is able to generate heatmaps on the images to visualize the features that it used to make its decision.
