# Cat-vs.-Dog-Classification-with-Heatmap-Visualization
This project is a machine learning model that can classify images into two categories: cats and dogs. It is also able to generate a heatmap on the image to visualize the features that it used to make its decision. The model can be used to classify any random image, as long as it contains a cat or a dog.
